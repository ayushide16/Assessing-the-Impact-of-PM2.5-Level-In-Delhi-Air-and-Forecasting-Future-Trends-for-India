# An Analysis of Air Quality in Delhi: Assessing the Impact of PM2.5 and Forecasting Future Trends for India

## Project Overview
This project investigates and analyzes Delhi's air quality from January 2021 to May 2023, with a focus on PM2.5 levels. It also forecasts future PM2.5 levels for India using historical data from 2017 to 2022. The research aims to provide insights and predictions to help address the severe air quality issues in Delhi and other regions of India.

## Data Description
<ul>
  <li>Location: Delhi, India (28.7041° N, 77.1025° E)</li>
  <li>Data Source: Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board</li>
  <li>Time Span: January 2021 to May 2023 for Delhi analysis; 2017 to 2022 for forecasting</li>
  <li>Stations: 11 different monitoring stations in Delhi</li>
</ul>

## Methodology
<ul>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of data trends and outliers using box plots, correlation matrices, bar graphs, and line graphs.</li>
  <li>Descriptive Analysis: Calculation of the coefficient of variation (C.V.) and consistency ranking of pollutants.</li>
  <li>Modeling:
    <ul>
      <li>SVM (Support Vector Machine)</li>
      <li>SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)</li>
      <li>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)</li>
      <li>Random Forest</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>


## Objectives
<ul>
  <li>Analyze recent air quality data for Delhi.</li>
  <li>Develop a time series model to forecast PM2.5 levels in India.</li>
  <li>Provide insights for policymakers and health departments to improve air quality.</li>
</ul>
